# Virtual Health Assistants In Healthcare.

My name is Fisayo, I'd be talking about Virtual assistants in healthcare, how it is necessary to provide patients with 24/7 access to healthcare information and support. The V.H.A can answer questions about symptoms, provide reminders for appointments and medication refills, and even help patients schedule virtual appointments with healthcare providers.
