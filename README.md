# Socio-cultural And Enviromental Effects On Healthy Living In Nigeria .

My name is Fisayo, I am from Nigeria.
In this blog, I would like to write about Socio-cultural And Enviromental Factors That Affect Healthy Living In Nigeria

Healthy living is one of the most precious gift from God. As the general saying goes, health is wealth. 
Every of our day-to-day activities is attached to us being fit, strong, and healthy to be able to achieve maximum productivity. This is because a poor health condition based on sociocultural and environmental factors reduces the productivity of citizens in carrying out their socioeconomic activities. Nigerians strive for a better healthcare system and healthy living irrespective of geographical location, and ethnicity notwithstanding the numerous challenges they come acrosss trying to achieve a common goal. On my blog, I'll be walking you through the exploration of the ignorance of the citizens on the health care system, Environmental contributions to healthy living in Nigeria, cultural and socio-economic effects on healthy living, among others. So sit back and relax, it's going to be an awesome journey. Cheers!
